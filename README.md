# AWS-AppSync-Project

Goal: 

Built a GraphQL API with AWS Amplify, reducing data retrieval time by 35\%.

Implemented frontend with Angular and TypeScript, enhancing performance by 27\%.

Optimized integration with AWS services, achieving 99.9\% uptime.


The project has been removed because I am facing an error. Once the error is resolved, and the app is back on track, I will upload the updated code with slight changes in the Angular app.
